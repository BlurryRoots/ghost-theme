**Responsive**
Uno looks great on all devices, even those weird phablets that nobody buys.

**Disqus comments**
Disqus integration allows users to comment on your posts.

**Foundation icons**
Uno contains the [Foundation icon font by Zurb](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) which means you can easily add icons. A full list of available icons can be found on the [Foundation Icon](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) website.

**No-JS fallback**
While JS is widely used, some themes and websites don't provide fallback for when no JS is available (I'm looking at you [Squarespace](http://blog.squarespace.com/)). If for some weird reason a visitor has JS disabled your blog will still be useable.

**1 theme, 5 colour options**
Uno includes 5 different colour options for you to chose from.
